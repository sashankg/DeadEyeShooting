# DeadEyeShooting
iOS Olympic Rifle Shooting 2D game

## Background
This was the first iOS app I had written when I was 12. While interning at FuguMobile in Shanghai, I was tasked with adapting an Android game to the iOS platform. I learned how to start an app from scratch and complete it. The app was written in Objective-C. 

## Gameplay
There are two game modes. 
The cross hairs of your rifle keep shaking. You need to use the joystick or accelerometer controls to move the target closer to the center. Once you feel that you have aimed correctly, clicking anywhere on the screen will fire. Based on how close you were to the target, a score is added to your result board.

## Other
You can select he name and country of your player. You can compare your score to the actual Olympic competitors as well as other players of the game in the leaderboards section.
